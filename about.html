            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>
                I choose to create different folders for all the images and the CSS and keep all my pages inside the
                root folder. Because of the small size of the project, I found that it gave a better overview, but if
                the
                project was bigger I would consider doing it another way.
            </p>

            <p>
                <img src="images/layout.png" alt="layout of the site">

                When it comes to the visual hierarchy I tried to make it look clean and respective, but also child
                friendly. The
                concept is to give the impression that we are under the sea. That's why I also added animations of
                bubbles.

                Since the topic itself is very important, I added some facts from their page. Since the facts might be
                considered "boring" for kids, I tried to appeal to them by adding the turtle, so it looks like he is
                following us through the website and helping them on
                their journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the game I chose Target group #1 â€“ primary education: age 6 - 13 (years 1-7), because I feel like
                targeting the group that is just beginning school or is young, will make a more significant impact on
                how they perceive this topic in the future. And hopefully, inspire them to make a difference as early as
                possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the game, I chose to make a picture domino, with an animal on one side and an
                ocean threat on the other. I decided to divide the game into two parts first to give some "facts"
                and pictures to create the right mindset. Then the kids are able to act and see the things they have
                learned.
            </p>

            <h2>Choices</h2>
            <p>
                For my typefaces, I chose a san serif font because it makes the website look clean and representable.
                The colors I chose were inspired by the blue from the page's logo, and the orangy color is inspired by
                the turtle to keep some
                contrast to the page. Even tho the blue use higher energy than some other colors, it was a suitable
                choice for the web design.
            </p>

            <p>
                I chose to add a max-width at 1440px for the body, as it was the 2022 standard for regular desktops
                according to my search.
            </p>

            <p>
                I used mostly grid throughout my page because I felt it gave more room when it comes to design and
                opportunities, compare to for example flex.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the responsive web design, I have two media queries. One for iPad-sized devices and also for small
                screens. On the small screens, I changed the design of the header for it to look cleaner. I also felt
                like keeping it fixed, would take up too much space when scrolling, so it is static instead. But I have
                added an "up" button to easily access the top of the page.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the form, if I was to choose a request method
                either POST or GET can be used in this case, since there is no direct sensitive data that is being
                inputed, but I chose GET.
            </p>

            <h2>Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
                When it comes to sustainability, I have tried to reduce the size of images and keep it to a minimum.

                I have compromised the file sizes and images to improve load speed and save energy.
                I have tried making reusable code through my page, but I see I could have planned it better for an even
                better outcome.
            </p>

            <p>
                On my google maps I have intentionally chosen to keep the default lazy load, so it only loads if the
                user
                scrolls down to the footer.
            </p>

            <p>
                When it comes to accessibility I have tried to use the alt attribute efficiently and added labels in the
                form. I tried to give the
                page an ok contrast when it comes to the colors. I used <a
                    href="https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker/index.php">Web Accessibility Checker</a> to check through
                my page. But these sites do not detect everything, so there is also necessary to manually look through
                as well.
            </p>

            <table>
                <tr>
