Comment:
If there are things that are repeated on multiple pages, like header, footer etc. I have only commented on the index.html file.

I started making the site for desktop, and then adding media queries for smaller screens. I have later realised that it is a better practice starting with the mobile version, and then media queries for bigger screens. Since it was not a requirement to start with one or the other, I left it as is because of time pressure.
I know because of that my CSS is more complex than it would have been, if I were to do it the other way. But designing mobile first is something I would practice on later occasions.

I got told I could put the tags/info for text and pictures I retrieved in the html as a comment or in this readme.txt. But in a real work it should be given credit in the footer or in the text. 

I tried to remove any errors when it comes to accessability from the https://wave.webaim.org/ page, but it gave me errors on the alt text on the turtle among other things, that I dont get how to do better.
